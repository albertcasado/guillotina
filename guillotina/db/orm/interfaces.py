        id has not been assigned.  Non-None object ids must be non-empty

        true -- The object has been modified since it was last saved.

        The object state may be changed by assigning or deleting this
        attribute; however, assigning None is ignored if the object is
        not in the saved state, and may be ignored even if the object is

        object activates the object; prior to 3.6, setting _p_changed to a
        true value on a ghost object was ignored.

        Note that an object can transition to the changed state only if
        it has a data manager.  When such a state change occurs, the
        'register' method of the data manager must be called, passing the
        persistent object.
